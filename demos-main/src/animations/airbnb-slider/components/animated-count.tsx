// The following component was started for this patreon post:
// AnimatedCount: https://www.patreon.com/posts/animated-text-84712135

// This component is used to animate a number by splitting it into digits
// and animating each digit separately.
// The animation in the old post was done by relying on the useState + LayoutAnimation API.

// The point is that since we're binding the animation to a Slider component,
// the updates are going to be very frequent and the LayoutAnimation API is not going to be able to keep up.

// So this is a completely different approach that relies fully on Reanimated.
// We use a shared value to store the count and we use a derived value to extract the digits from the count.
// Then we animate each digit separately.
// This approach is much more efficient and it's going to be able to keep up with the frequent updates.

// But there's a catch: we need to know the maximum number of digits that we're going to have :/
// Of course, we could use a dynamic approach and calculate the number of digits based on the count,
// but that would mean that we would have to re-render the component every time the count changes.
// And that's not what we want (if the amount of digits isn't too big).
