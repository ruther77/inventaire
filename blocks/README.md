![image](./app/opengraph-image.png)

Accessible and customizable blocks that you can copy and paste into your apps. Free. Open Source.

## Usage

To use blocks from this registry, configure your `components.json` file with the remote registry:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@blocks": "https://blocks.so/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Then add blocks to your project using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
# Add a specific block
npx shadcn@latest add @blocks/login-01

# Add a dialog block
npx shadcn@latest add @blocks/dialog-01

# Add a sidebar block
npx shadcn@latest add @blocks/sidebar-01
```

Alternatively, you can add blocks directly from the registry:

```bash
# Using the direct registry URL
npx shadcn@latest add https://blocks.so/r/login-01.json
```
